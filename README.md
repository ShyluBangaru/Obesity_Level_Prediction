# 🧬 Obesity Level Prediction Using Data Mining Techniques

This project aims to predict an individual's obesity level using supervised learning and statistical analysis. We explore a dataset with multiple lifestyle and physical attributes to classify obesity categories using regression models and data mining techniques.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Understand contributing factors to obesity across different populations.
- Analyze correlations between lifestyle choices and BMI.
- Build a predictive model for obesity level classification using regression and statistical tests.

---

## 📊 Dataset Overview

- **Source:** [Kaggle - Obesity Levels](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fatemehmehrparvar/obesity-levels/data)
- **Records:** 2,111
- **Attributes:** 17 features
- **Target Variable:** `NObesityedad` (Obesity level category)
- **Countries Represented:** Mexico, Peru, Colombia

---

## 🔄 Variable Transformation

- Non-numeric categorical variables were converted into numerical codes for statistical modeling.
- Sample transformations included encoding gender, family history, food intake frequency, and activity levels.

---

## 🔍 Techniques Used

- **Summary Statistics & Visual Analysis**
  - Boxplots, correlation matrices, and descriptive statistics for all variables.
- **Multi Linear Regression (MLR)**
  - Model built to predict obesity level using continuous predictors.
- **Chi-Squared Test**
  - Applied to evaluate relationships between categorical variables and obesity.
- **ANOVA**
  - Performed on continuous variables to validate their contribution to obesity level prediction.

---

## 📈 Key Insights

- Strong positive correlation between **weight** and **obesity level**.
- Noticeable associations between **family history of obesity** and individual obesity status.
- Height and gender showed meaningful distribution patterns.
- P-values from regression indicated significant predictors.

---

## 🧪 Next Steps

- Incorporate advanced ML techniques (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forests).
- Tune regression model using backward elimination and adjusted R².
- Evaluate using metrics like RMSE, R², MAE on a validation set.
- Build a classification model using Decision Trees or Logistic Regression.
